# Synopsis:
#
# When included in a root GitLab CI configuration, the following jobs will
# take care of creating and publishing branched (master / next) contents of the
# project's GitLab Pages (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).
#
# In your root CI configuration, define a hidden job `.pages` with all content
# generating jobs from prior stages listed in `dependencies`.
# Additionaly, define the `stage:` parameter with a valid stage.
#
# Note: Each prior job's content must be put in a unique directory, which
# should be listed as that job's artifact
#
# The resulting url of the GitLab pages will be generated as follows:
# <user>.gitlab.io/<project>/<branch>/<artifact directory>/
# E.g. for an artifact directory `docs` from `master` in
# `eyeo/adblockplus/adblockpluschrome`:
#
# eyeo.gitlab.io/adblockpluschrome/master/docs/
